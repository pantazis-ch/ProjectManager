# Project Manager

Project Manager is an app that facilitates the planning and development of small-scale projects. With
Project Manager, you can handle multiple projects with ease. For each project, you can create
specification lists, task lists, and deadline lists. Apart from rigid lists, you can write ideas and notes
about your projects. In addition, you can set notifications about upcoming deadlines and view the
remaining tasks and deadlines of your projects in separate home screen widgets. In order to use the app,
you need to sign up with your Google Account. Once you are signed up you can access your data from
any Android device.
